where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has become an integral part of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh is</br></br>
really about celebrating the simpler,rural roots of the Bengal. As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to </br></br>
reveal one's class,religion, or financial capacity.Othercultural festivals include Nabonno, and Poush porbon (festival of Poush), both Bengali harvest festivals.</br></br>

War.These  occasions are observed with public ceremonies, parades,rallies by citizens,political speeches,fairs, concerts,and  various other public and private</br></br>
events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh.TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. And many schools and </br></br>
