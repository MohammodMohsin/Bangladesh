Bangladesh is a country in South Asia. It is bordered by India to its west, north and east; Myanmar (Burma) to its southeast; and is separated from Nepal and</br></br>
Bhutan by the Chicken's Neck corridor. To its south, it faces the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is the world's eighth-most populous country, with over 168 million </br></br>
people. It is one of the mostdensely populated countries, and among countries with a population exceeding 10 million, it is the most denselypopulated. It</br></br>
forms part of the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal, along with the neighbouring Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura.</br></br></br>

The present-day borders of Bangladesh took shape during the Partition of Bengal and the British India in 1947, when the region came to be known as East </br></br>
Pakistan, as a part of the newly formed state of Pakistan. It was separated from West Pakistan by 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) of Indian territory. Because of</br></br>
political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination and economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, nationalism, popular agitation and civil</br></br>
disobedience led to the Bangladesh Liberation War and independence in 1971. After independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil </br></br>
and military coups. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. In 2014, the Bangladeshi general election</br></br>
was boycotted by major opposition parties,resulting in a parliament and government dominated by the Awami League and its smaller coalition partners. </br></br></br>

Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic with an elected parliament called the Jatiyo Sangshad. The native Bengalis form the country's largest ethnic </br></br>
group, along with indigenous peoples in northern and southeastern districts.Geographically the country is dominated by the fertile Bengal delta,the world's</br></br>
largest delta.This also givesBangladesh a unique name tag as "the land of rivers". Bangladesh has a rich heritage of ancient civilization. Bangladesh's</br></br>
documented history spans 4,000 years .Bangladesh human history has lasted for more than 20,000 years.</br></br></br>

Bangladesh is a Next Eleven emerging economy. It has achieved significant strides in human and social developmentsince independence, including progress in </br></br>
gender equality, universal primary education, food production, health, and population control.However, Bangladesh continues to face numerous political, </br></br>
economic, social and environmental challenges, including political instability, corruption, poverty, overpopulation, and global warming.</br></br></br>

The country is a founding member of SAARC, the Developing 8 Countries and BIMSTEC. It contributes one of the largest peacekeeping forces to the United </br></br>
Nations.It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations,the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Non-Aligned Movement. </br></br></br>
