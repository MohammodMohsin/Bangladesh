Sylhet Division  also known as Greater Sylhet or Sylhet region, is the northeastern division of Bangladesh, named after its main city,</br></br>
Sylhet. It is bounded by Meghalaya State of India on the north, Tripura State on the south, Assam State of India on the east and Dhaka</br></br>
division on the west and Chittagong division on the southwest.One of the most picturesque and archeologically rich regions in South</br></br>
Asia, is the Sylhet Division. Its bourgeoning economy has become a part of the attractions of the region, as landscapes are filled with </br></br>
fragrant orange and pineapple gardens and breathtaking tea plantations. Many Sylhet community members have found work and</br></br>
residence abroad, particularly in the United Kingdom and have been using remittances to fund projects and industries within the </br></br>
Sylhet Division, allowing the export industry and foreign investment sectors to grow.
</br></br>

In 1995, Sylhet was declared the 6th division of the country. Prior to that it was part of the Chittagong Division. The Sylhet Division</br></br>
is subdivided into four districts (zillah): Habiganj, Maulvibazar, Sunamganj and Sylhet. Further, the Sylhet Division contains 35 sub-</br></br>
districts (upazila/thana), 323 union parishad, 10,185 villages and 14 municipalities.Population: approximately 10 million, which is</br></br>
less than 7% of the total population of Bangladesh.</br></br>

The 14th century marked the beginning of Islamic influence in Sylhet. A Muslim saint, Hazrat Shaikh al Mushaek Jalal Uddin,</br></br>
popularly known as Shah Jalal, arrived in Sylhet in 1303 CE from Mecca via Delhi with 360 Sufi saints and army generals such as</br></br>
Sikander Ghazi, Syed Nasiruddin and Khwaja Burhanuddin Qahtan defeating Govinda of Gaur.Sikander Ghazi was the direct </br></br>
nephew of Sultan Feroze Shah of Delhi. Under the spiritual leadership of Hazrat Shah Jalal and his 360 companions the local Hindus </br></br>
were brought under control and they began to spread Islam. He died in Sylhet in or around the year 1350 CE. His shrine is located</br></br>
inside the parameter of the mosque complex known as Dargah-e-Shah Jalal. Even today Shah Jalal remains revered; visitors arrive</br></br>
from all over Bangladesh and beyond to pay homage. Saint Shah Jalal and his companions were responsible for the conversion of </br></br>
most of the populace from their earlier beliefs in Hinduism, Buddhism and Paganism to Islam. Shortly, thereafter, Sylhet became a</br></br>
centre of Islam in Bengal. In the official documents and historical papers, Sylhet was often referred to as Jalalabad during the era of</br></br>
the Muslim rule. </br></br>
In the late 18th century, the British East India Company became interested in Sylhet and saw it as an area  of strategic importance in</br></br>
the war against Burma. Sylhet gradually was absorbed into British control and administration and was governed as a part of Bengal.</br></br>
After the British administrative reorganization of India, Sylhet was eventually incorporated into Assam. It remained a part of Assam </br></br>
for the rest of the era of British rule. In 1947, following a referendum, almost all of erstwhile Sylhet became a part of East Pakistan, </br></br>
barring the Karimganj subdivision which was incorporated into the new Indian state of  Assam. The referendum was held on 3 July</br></br>
1947, there were a total of 546,815 votes cast on 239 polling stations, a majority of 43.8 per cent voted in favour of East Bengal. </br></br>
There were protests regarding bogus votes. However, the referendum was acknowledged by Article 3 of the India Independence Act</br></br>
of 18 July 1947. In 1971, Sylhet became part of the newly formed independent country of Bangladesh.The Sylhet region has a </br></br>
"friendship link" with the city of St Albans, in the United Kingdom. The link was established in 1988 when the District council </br></br>
supported a housing project in Sylhet as part of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. Sylhet was chosen because it is the</br></br>
area of origin for the largest ethnic minority group in St Albans.</br></br>
