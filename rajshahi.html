infrastructure. The divisional capital of Rajshahi is only four hours road journey away from Dhaka, the capital city.</br></br>
Until 2010 this Division comprised 16 districts, but early in that year it was divided into two, when a new Division (Rangpur </br></br>
Division) was formed out of the 8 northerly districts that until then had been part of Rajshahi Division.Rajshahi was dominated by</br></br>
various Rajas, Maharajas and Zamindars.

another famous river, Jamuna, lies across the eastern border. In the West, Rajshahi division shares a border with India.</br></br>
The major cities of Rajshahi division are Rajshahi, Bogra and Pabna. Rajshahi has an airport, with daily flights to Dhaka.</br></br>
