<br> The British East India Company gained control of Bengal after defeating its last independent Nawab at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Company rule saw the</br></br>
formation of the Bengal Presidency. The company instituted the Permanent Settlement in 1793. At its peak, the presidency's jurisdiction included large parts of</br></br>
North India,Burma and the Malacca Straits.The mutiny of 1857 resulted in the transfer of authority directly to the British crown under a viceregal government.</br></br>
After the foundation of the British Indian Empire, Bengal was still under the heavy influence of British culture,including architecture,education and art.The </br></br>
region was a hotbed of revolutionary and anti-colonial movements to overthrow the British Empire. Between 1905 and 1911, an abortive partition created the </br></br>
short lived province of Eastern Bengal and Assam.</br></br>
The 1937 elections ushered the first democratically elected government in the region. A. K. Fazlul Huq of the Krishak Praja Party became the first elected</br></br>
Premier of British Bevngal. The Lahore Resolution was adopted in 1942.It called for the creation of independent states in eastern and northwestern British</br></br>
India. The Muslim League formed a coalition government in 1943, with Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin as premier.During the Second World War,the Japanese Air</br></br>
Force conducted air raids in Chittagong.Allied forces were stationed in bases across the region in support of the Burma Campaign. After the war, the British</br></br>
government began plans for a quick exit from the subcontinent.Negotiations between political parties,principally the Muslim League and the Congress,led to</br></br>
the partition plan of 1947,despite a proposal for a United Bengal,mooted by the liberal democratic Prime Minister of Bengal H. S. Suhrawardy.Famine struck</br></br> 
Bengal several times during British rule, including in 1770 and 1943.</br></br>
East Pakistan</br></br>

Following the exit of the British Empire in 1947,Bengal was partitioned along religious lines,with the western part going to newly created India and the eastern</br></br>
part (Muslim majority) joining Pakistan as a province calledEast Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan),with Dhaka as its capital.The Bengali Language </br></br>
Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan.</br></br>

East Pakistan was a component in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the </br></br>
feudal zamindari system.Despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan's government and military were largely dominated by the upper</br></br>
classes from the west. The Bengali Language Movement of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan.Dissatisfaction with the </br></br>
central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade,during which the Awami League emerged as the political voice </br></br>
of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for autonomy in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib), was jailed; he was </br></br>
released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising. In 1970, a massive cyclone devastated the coast of East Pakistan, killing up to half a million people </br></br>
and the central government's response was seen as poor.The anger of the Bengali population was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose Awami</br></br>
League had won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections,was blocked from taking office. After staging compromise talks with Mujibur Rahman, </br></br>
President Yahya Khan and military officials launched Operation Searchlight,a sustained military  assault on East Pakistan,and arrested Mujibur Rahman</br></br>
in the early hours of 26 March 1971.Yahya's methods were extremely bloody,and the violence of the war resulted in many civilian deaths.Yahya's chief targets</br></br>
included intellectuals andHindus,and about one million refugees fled to neighbouring India.Estimates of those massacred throughout the war range from thirty </br></br>
thousand to three million.Mujibur Rahman was ultimately released on 8 January 1972.Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in Calcutta, India.</br></br>
The exile government formally took oath at Meherpur, in the Kustia district of East Pakistan, on 17 April 1971, with Tajuddin Ahmad as the first Prime</br></br>
Minister and Syed Nazrul Islam as the Acting President.The Bangladesh Liberation War lasted for nine months.A resistance force known as the Mukti Bahini </br></br>
was formed from the Bangladesh Forces (consisting of Bengali regular forces) in alliance with civilian fighters such as the Kader Bahini and the Hemayet </br></br>
Bahini. Led by General M. A. G. Osmani, the Bangladesh Forces were organized into eleven sectors and, as part of Mukti Bahini, conducted a massive </br></br>
guerrilla war against the Pakistan Forces.The war witnessed the 1971 Bangladesh genocide,in which the Pakistan Army and its allied religious militias carried</br></br>
out a wide-scale elimination of Bengali civilians,intellectuals,youth,students,politicians, activists and religious minorities. By winter, Bangladesh-India Allied</br></br>
Forces defeated the Pakistan Army,culminating  in its surrender and the Liberation of Dhaka on 16 December 1971.</br></br>

1972 After independence, the Constitution of Bangladesh established a unitary secular multiparty parliamentary democratic system. The Awami League won</br></br>
the first general elections in 1973 with a massive mandate, gaining an absolute parliamentary majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974, </br></br>
and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed BAKSAL. On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were </br></br>
assassinated by mid-level military officers.Vice President Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed was sworn in as President with most of Mujib's cabinet intact. Two</br></br>
Army uprisings on 3 and 7 November 1975 led to a reorganised structure of power.A state of emergency was declared to restore order and calm. Mushtaq</br></br>
resigned, and the country was placed under temporary martial law,with three service chiefs serving as deputies to the new president,Justice Abu Sayem,who</br></br>
also became the Chief Martial Law Administrator.Lieutenant General Ziaur Rahman took over the presidency in 1977 when Justice Sayem resigned.President</br></br>
Zia reinstated multi-party politics,introduced free markets, and founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by</br></br>
elements of the military in 1981.Bangladesh's next major ruler was Lieutenant General Hossain Mohammad Ershad, who gained power in a coup on 24 March </br></br>
1982,and ruled until 6 December 1990,when he was forced to resign after a revolt of all major political parties  and the public,along with pressure from Western </br></br>
donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union).</br></br>
Lt General Ziaur Rahman served as President (1977-1981) and CMLA (1977-1979) Since then,Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy.Zia's </br></br>
widow,Khaleda Zia,led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991 and became the first female Prime Minister in </br></br>
Bangladeshi history. The fifth parliamentary brings Bangladesh nationalist party with Khaleda Zia, and a parliament system was set in place. However, the </br></br>
Awami League, headed by Sheikh Hasina, one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. The Awami League lost again to the Bangladesh </br></br>
Nationalist Party in 2001.Widespread political unrest followed the resignation of the BNP in late October 2006, but the caretaker government worked to bring</br></br>
the parties to election within the required ninety days. At the last minute in early January, the Awami League withdrew from the election scheduled for later </br></br>
that month. On 11 January 2007, the military intervened to support both a state of emergency and a continuing but neutral caretaker government under a newly </br></br>
appointed Chief Advisor, who was not a politician. The country had suffered for decades from extensive corruption,disorder, and political violence. The </br></br>
caretakergovernment worked to root out corruption from all levels of government.It arrested on corruption charges more than 160 people,including politicians,</br></br>
civil servants, and businessmen,among whom were both major party leaders, some of their senior staff, and two sons of Khaleda Zia.After working to clean up</br></br>
the system, the caretaker government held what was described by observers as a largelyfree and fair election on 29 December 2008.The Awami League's </br></br>
Sheikh Hasina won with a two-thirds landslide in the elections; she took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009.</br></br>
