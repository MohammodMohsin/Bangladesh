Sport in Bangladesh is popular and widespread. The most popular sport in Bangladesh is cricket, Bangladesh being the top 9th team in the world, followed by</br></br>
football (soccer), and kabaddi. Kabaddi is the national sport of Bangladesh.</br></br></br>
<p align="center"><u><b>CRICKET</b></u></p></br></br> </br>
<div align="center">

</div>	</br></br>
Cricket is a game which has a massive and passionate following in Bangladesh.There is a strong domestic league which on many occasions also saw players</br></br>
from foreign countries gracing the cricket fields of Bangladesh. Bangladesh received it's test status from ICC in 2000, which is a requirement for the countries </br></br>
to play Test cricket. The Bangladesh national cricket team's official logo is Royal Bengal Tiger, by which they are often referred at media.</br></br>

The cricketing culture is not a new phenomenon in Bangladesh.Similar to other subcontinental countries,the game itself was first introduced to the Ganges-</br></br>
Brahmaputra delta region by the British rulers nearly two centuries ago.For the better part of the British rule,cricket remained a recreational game for the</br></br>
aristocrats,inaccessible to the common people because of colonial class distinctions and the complicated nature of the game which the locals were not able to</br></br>
comprehend easily. Following the liberation war which ended in Bangladesh gaining independence in 1971, cricketing popularity has continued to grow.</br></br>
The Bangladesh Cricket team is coached by Australian Jamie Siddons. Often criticized for their poor performances, Bangladesh most recently enjoyed a good</br></br>
run of form, defeating New Zealand 4-0 in a 5 match ODI series held in  Mirpur, Dhaka. Bangladesh will also be one of the hosts of the 2011 Cricket World</br></br>
Cup.

Football is popular in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is currently ranked 150th in the FIFA ranking. Bangladesh became the 2003 South Asian Football Federation </br></br>
(SAFF) champion. SAFF includes Southern Asian countries and other countries  from Asia.The Bangladesh national football team is controlled by the national</br></br>
governing body, the Bangladesh Football   Federation,which is a member of the AFC. The side has yet to qualify for a FIFA World Cup tournament. They were </br></br> 
eliminated in the first round of their only Asian Cup appearance to date in 1980. As is the case elsewhere on the subcontinent, the national football team stands</br></br>
somewhat in the shadow of the country's Test cricket team. The team was founded in 1972, and joined FIFA in 1974.</br></br>
Apart from wins over Indonesia and Thailand in their first ever World Cup qualification in 1986, Bangladesh has  struggled to impose itself. At the regional</br></br>
level, they have also remained in the second echelon while in Asia, the team is constantly trying to avoid being the wooden spoon of their group.</br></br>
Football in Bangladesh has a huge following which was exemplified when the national team made history in their victory at the South Asian Football </br></br>
Federation Cup in 2003. The South Asia side won the final via penalties over Maldives before 50,000 home supporters.</br></br>
Kazi Salahuddin is Bangladesh's most famous footballer, having played professional football in Hong Kong, the first Bangldeshi player to ever do so.</br></br>
Another famous player is Chingla Mong Chowdhury Murruy. He is a renowned soccer personality in Bangladesh. He used to play before the liberation war. He</br></br>
coached BRTC, was an assistant coach for BKSP. He also received his national award in football. He fought in the Liberation War in 1971 for his country.</br></br></br>

<div align="center">

</div>	</br></br>
Kabaddi is a team game. Two teams of seven players occupy opposite halves of a field of 12.5m x 10m divided by a line into two halves. The teams take turns</br></br>
sending a "raider" across to the opposite team's half, where the goal is to tag or wrestle ("capture") members of the opposite team before returning to the home</br></br>
half. Tagged members are "out" and are sent off the field. The raider must not take a breath during the raid, and must prove it by constantly chanting (called </br></br>
'cant' or 'dak') during the raid. Meanwhile, the defenders must form a chain, for example by linking hands; if the chain is broken, a member of the defending</br></br>
team is sent off. The goal of the defenders is to stop the raider from returning to the home side before taking a breath.</br></br>
In 1980, Bangladesh became the runners-up in the first Asian Kabaddi Championship and India emerged as the  champion. Bangladesh became runners-up</br></br>
again in the next Asian Kabaddi Championship held in 1985 at Jaipur, India.</br></br>
Bangladeshi kabaddi team won the bronze medal at the 2006 Asian Games.</br></br></br>
